# Network Defense Strategy and Incident Response Plan

## Network Defense Strategy

A comprehensive network defense strategy incorporates multiple layers of
security (defense-in-depth) to protect against evolving threats.

### 1. Firewalls

-   Deploy **next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)** to filter traffic at
    both packet and application layers.
-   Enforce strict inbound and outbound traffic rules.
-   Implement **stateful inspection** to monitor active connections.
-   Use **web application firewalls (WAFs)** for protecting web
    applications.

### 2. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

-   IDS monitors traffic for suspicious activity and generates alerts.
-   IPS actively blocks or mitigates detected threats in real time.
-   Deploy both **network-based IDS/IPS** and **host-based IDS/IPS**.
-   Regularly update signatures and use anomaly-based detection.

### 3. Endpoint Protection

-   Antivirus and anti-malware solutions on all endpoints.
-   Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools for advanced threat
    detection.
-   Regular patch management to keep systems updated.

### 4. Network Segmentation

-   Separate critical systems from general user networks.
-   Use VLANs and subnets to limit lateral movement.
-   Deploy **zero-trust architecture** with least privilege access.

### 5. Encryption and Secure Protocols

-   Enforce **HTTPS, SSH, SFTP** over insecure protocols (HTTP, Telnet,
    FTP).
-   Encrypt sensitive data both **in transit** and **at rest**.
-   Deploy VPNs for remote access with MFA.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

-   Centralized logging (SIEM solutions like Splunk, ELK Stack).
-   Real-time monitoring for anomalies.
-   Retain logs for forensic investigation.

### 7. Additional Mechanisms

-   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
-   Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
-   Security awareness training for employees.

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)

An effective IRP ensures rapid detection, response, and recovery from
network security incidents.

### 1. Preparation

-   Define roles and responsibilities of the incident response team
    (IRT).
-   Maintain updated contact lists (internal teams, external vendors,
    law enforcement).
-   Regularly train employees with phishing simulations and awareness
    programs.

### 2. Identification (Detection)

-   Use IDS/IPS, SIEM, and monitoring tools to detect anomalies.
-   Establish baseline network behavior to identify deviations.
-   Confirm whether the event is a true security incident.

### 3. Containment

-   **Short-term:** Isolate affected systems to prevent spread.
-   **Long-term:** Apply security patches, update firewall/IDS rules,
    and monitor traffic.

### 4. Eradication

-   Remove malware, disable compromised accounts, and close exploited
    vulnerabilities.
-   Conduct forensic analysis to determine root cause.

### 5. Recovery

-   Restore systems from clean backups.
-   Gradually reconnect systems to the network with continuous
    monitoring.
-   Validate integrity and functionality before resuming operations.

### 6. Lessons Learned

-   Conduct a **post-incident review**.
-   Update policies, defense mechanisms, and training based on findings.
-   Document the incident and share insights with stakeholders.

## Key Takeaway

A strong network defense strategy minimizes the chances of compromise,
while a well-structured incident response plan ensures quick recovery
and reduces the impact of security breaches.
