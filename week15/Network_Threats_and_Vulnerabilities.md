# Network Threats and Vulnerabilities

## Common Network Threats

1.  **Malware**
    -   Viruses, worms, trojans
    -   Ransomware (e.g., WannaCry)
    -   Spyware and adware
    -   Rootkits
2.  **Phishing**
    -   Email phishing
    -   Spear phishing (targeted attacks)
    -   Whaling (targeting executives)
    -   Smishing (SMS phishing)
    -   Vishing (voice phishing)
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
    -   SYN flood attacks
    -   UDP flood
    -   Application layer attacks (e.g., HTTP flood)
    -   Amplification attacks (e.g., DNS amplification)
4.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
    -   Session hijacking
    -   Eavesdropping
    -   SSL stripping
5.  **Password Attacks**
    -   Brute-force attacks
    -   Dictionary attacks
    -   Credential stuffing
6.  **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**
    -   Long-term, targeted intrusions
    -   Use of zero-day exploits
7.  **Insider Threats**
    -   Malicious insiders
    -   Negligent employees
8.  **Social Engineering**
    -   Pretexting
    -   Baiting
    -   Tailgating / Piggybacking
9.  **Ransomware Attacks**
    -   Encrypting files and demanding ransom
    -   Double extortion (encrypt + data leak)
10. **Supply Chain Attacks**
    -   Exploiting third-party vendors
    -   Infected software updates

## Common Vulnerabilities

1.  **Unpatched Software**
    -   Missing security updates
    -   Legacy systems still in use
2.  **Weak Authentication and Authorization**
    -   Default or weak passwords
    -   Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
3.  **Network Misconfigurations**
    -   Open ports and unused services
    -   Misconfigured firewalls
    -   Improperly segmented networks
    -   Publicly exposed sensitive services (e.g., databases, SSH, RDP)
4.  **Insecure Protocols**
    -   Use of outdated protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, HTTP)
    -   Weak encryption (e.g., SSLv2, WEP)
5.  **Insufficient Monitoring and Logging**
    -   Lack of intrusion detection systems (IDS)
    -   Incomplete log retention
6.  **Default Configurations**
    -   Default credentials left unchanged
    -   Unnecessary administrative access
7.  **Vulnerable Web Applications**
    -   SQL injection
    -   Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    -   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
8.  **IoT Device Vulnerabilities**
    -   Weak or hardcoded credentials
    -   Lack of firmware updates
9.  **Cloud Security Misconfigurations**
    -   Publicly accessible S3 buckets
    -   Overly permissive IAM roles
10. **Poor Patch Management**
    -   Delayed response to critical CVEs
    -   Lack of centralized patching strategy

## Key Takeaway

A secure network requires continuous monitoring, timely patching, strong
authentication mechanisms, and careful configuration management to
defend against evolving threats and vulnerabilities.
