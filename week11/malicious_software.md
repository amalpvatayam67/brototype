# Malicious Software (Malware) Types and Their Impact

Malicious software, commonly known as **malware**, refers to programs designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise a computer system, network, or user data. Below is a detailed overview of different types of malware and related attack techniques.

## **a) Malware, Viruses, Worms, Keyloggers, Phishing, Smishing, Spoofing**

### **1. Malware**
- **Definition:** Umbrella term for all harmful software, including viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, ransomware, etc.
- **Impact:** Can steal data, damage files, disrupt systems, or enable unauthorized access.

### **2. Viruses**
- **Definition:** Malicious code that attaches itself to files and spreads when those files are executed.
- **Impact:** Corrupts or deletes files, slows down systems, and spreads across networks.

### **3. Worms**
- **Definition:** Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread across systems without user action.
- **Impact:** Consumes network bandwidth, crashes systems, and delivers additional payloads.

### **4. Keyloggers**
- **Definition:** Software or hardware that records keystrokes.
- **Impact:** Captures passwords, credit card numbers, and confidential information.

### **5. Phishing**
- **Definition:** Social engineering attack using deceptive emails/websites to trick users into revealing sensitive data.
- **Impact:** Credential theft, identity fraud, and financial loss.

### **6. Smishing**
- **Definition:** Phishing via SMS messages containing malicious links or requests.
- **Impact:** Steals login credentials, installs malware, or scams victims.

### **7. Spoofing**
- **Definition:** Impersonating a trusted entity (email, IP, or website) to deceive victims.
- **Impact:** Enables phishing, malware delivery, and fraud.

## **b) Spyware, Backdoors, Reverse Shells, Bind Shells**

### **1. Spyware**
- **Definition:** Covertly collects information from a system without the userâ€™s consent.
- **Impact:** Monitors browsing habits, steals credentials, and sends data to attackers.

### **2. Backdoors**
- **Definition:** Hidden entry points allowing attackers to bypass normal authentication.
- **Impact:** Enables persistent remote access and further exploitation.

### **3. Reverse Shells**
- **Definition:** A shell session initiated from the victim machine to the attacker's machine.
- **Impact:** Allows attackers to control compromised devices while bypassing firewalls.

### **4. Bind Shells**
- **Definition:** A shell session where the victim machine opens a listening port for attackers to connect.
- **Impact:** Grants attackers direct command execution on the system.

## **c) Adware, Trojans, Rootkits**

### **1. Adware**
- **Definition:** Software that displays unwanted advertisements.
- **Impact:** Slows systems, collects user data, and may lead to further infections.

### **2. Trojans**
- **Definition:** Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software.
- **Impact:** Steals data, installs other malware, and provides remote access to attackers.

### **3. Rootkits**
- **Definition:** Malware designed to hide its presence and other malicious processes.
- **Impact:** Provides attackers with administrative control, hides malicious activity, and is hard to detect.
