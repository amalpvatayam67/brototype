# Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

## **1. Introduction**
A **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of requests.  
A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack is similar, but the traffic originates from multiple compromised systems (botnets), making it harder to mitigate.

## **2. Types of DoS and DDoS Attacks**

### **a) Volume-Based Attacks**
- **Description:** Overwhelm bandwidth with massive amounts of traffic.
- **Example:** UDP Flood, ICMP Flood.
- **Impact:** Network saturation, making services unreachable.

### **b) Protocol Attacks**
- **Description:** Exploit weaknesses in Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the OSI model.
- **Example:** SYN Flood, Ping of Death.
- **Impact:** Exhausts server resources such as connection tables.

### **c) Application Layer Attacks**
- **Description:** Target Layer 7 (HTTP, DNS, SMTP) to exhaust server resources.
- **Example:** HTTP GET/POST Flood.
- **Impact:** High CPU usage, service downtime.

## **3. Real-World Examples and Case Studies**

### **Case Study 1: GitHub DDoS Attack (2018)**
- **Details:** GitHub faced a **1.35 Tbps** DDoS attack using memcached amplification.
- **Impact:** Temporary outage for about 20 minutes before mitigation.
- **Mitigation:** Used Akamai Prolexic to absorb and filter malicious traffic.

### **Case Study 2: Dyn DNS DDoS Attack (2016)**
- **Details:** Attack on DNS provider Dyn using the Mirai botnet, composed of IoT devices.
- **Impact:** Major services like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit went offline for hours.
- **Mitigation:** Traffic filtering, blocking malicious IPs, and better IoT device security.

### **Case Study 3: Estonia DoS Attacks (2007)**
- **Details:** Nationwide cyberattacks targeted government, banking, and media websites.
- **Impact:** Disrupted national communications and e-services for weeks.
- **Mitigation:** IP blacklisting, routing traffic through protected networks.

## **4. Impact of DoS and DDoS Attacks**
- **Financial Loss:** Downtime leads to loss of revenue.
- **Reputation Damage:** Customers lose trust in the service.
- **Operational Disruption:** Interrupts internal communications and workflows.
- **Collateral Damage:** Other network-connected services may be affected.

## **5. Mitigation Strategies**

### **a) Prevention**
1. **Network Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Block suspicious traffic patterns.
2. **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests from a single IP.
3. **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.

### **b) Detection**
1. **Traffic Monitoring:** Detect unusual traffic spikes early.
2. **Anomaly Detection Systems:** Identify patterns of DDoS attacks.

### **c) Response**
1. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Absorb large volumes of traffic.
2. **Blackholing / Sinkholing:** Redirect malicious traffic to a null route.
3. **Cloud-Based DDoS Protection:** Use services like Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS Shield.

## **6. Conclusion**
DoS and DDoS attacks remain a significant cybersecurity threat. While complete prevention is challenging, early detection, robust network architecture, and responsive mitigation strategies can significantly reduce their impact.
