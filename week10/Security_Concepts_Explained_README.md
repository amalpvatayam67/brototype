# Key Security Concepts: Threats, Weaknesses, Vulnerabilities, Payloads, and Exploits

Understanding these foundational cybersecurity terms is essential for recognizing and preventing attacks.

---

## Threat
**Definition**: A threat is any potential danger that can exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm.

**Example**: A hacker attempting to steal login credentials via phishing emails is a **threat**.

---

## Weakness
**Definition**: A weakness is a design flaw or implementation bug that may lead to a vulnerability.

**Example**: Using outdated hashing algorithms like MD5 for password storage is a **weakness**.

---

## Vulnerability
**Definition**: A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat actor.

**Example**: CVE-2024-3094 in OpenSSH allowed remote code execution — a serious **vulnerability**.

---

## Payload
**Definition**: The part of malware that performs a malicious action once delivered.

**Example**: A ransomware's payload encrypts files and demands payment — this is the **payload**.

---

## Exploit
**Definition**: An exploit is the actual code or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

**Example**: Exploiting a buffer overflow to gain unauthorized access is an **exploit**.

| Weakness      | Design flaw or poor configuration                       | Use of weak hash like MD5                                 |
| Vulnerability | Exploitable security gap                                | OpenSSH RCE vulnerability (CVE-2024-3094)                 |
| Payload       | Malicious part of malware                               | Ransomware encryption module                              |
| Exploit       | Code or method to take advantage of vulnerability       | Buffer overflow shell injection                           |
