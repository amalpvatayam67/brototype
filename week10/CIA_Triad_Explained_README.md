# 🔐 Understanding the CIA Triad in Cybersecurity

The CIA Triad — **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** — forms the core foundation of information security.

---

## 1. Confidentiality

### Definition:

Protecting information from unauthorized access or disclosure.

### Key Methods:

- Encryption
- Authentication (passwords, MFA)
- Access control (RBAC, ACLs)

### Real-World Examples:

- **Encrypted Messaging** (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp): Prevents eavesdropping.
- **Banking Login with 2FA**: Stops attackers from accessing your account even if they steal your password.
- **Medical Records Access**: Only authorized doctors can view patient records.

---

## 2. Integrity

### Definition:

Ensuring data is accurate, complete, and not tampered with.

### Key Methods:

- Checksums and hashes (SHA-256)
- Digital signatures
- Version control and audit logs

### Real-World Examples:

- **Digital Signatures in Emails**: Confirms the message hasn’t been altered.
- **Software Update Hash Checks**: Validates the file wasn't modified or corrupted.
- **Blockchain Ledger**: Each block links with hashes to ensure integrity.

---

## 3. Availability

### Definition:

Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

### Key Methods:

- Redundancy and failover systems
- Load balancing
- DDoS mitigation
- Backups

### Real-World Examples:

- **Cloud Uptime Guarantees**: Services like AWS and Google Cloud offer 99.99% uptime.
- **DDoS Mitigation Services** (e.g., Cloudflare): Protect against denial-of-service attacks.
- **Database Backups**: Allow recovery after hardware failure or ransomware.

| Principle       | Definition                                 | Example                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Prevent unauthorized access to data        | End-to-end encrypted chat apps                      |
| Integrity       | Ensure data accuracy and trustworthiness   | File hash verification before software installation |
| Availability    | Ensure authorized users have timely access | Cloud services with load balancing and backups      |

> A strong cybersecurity posture balances all three pillars — too much focus on one can harm the others.
