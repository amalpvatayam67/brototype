# 🛡️ Understanding CVE and CWE + Recent Examples

---

## What is CVE?

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is a public database of disclosed security vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems. Each entry has a unique ID (e.g., CVE-2024-12345).

- Managed by: MITRE Corporation
- Purpose: Standardize vulnerability tracking across tools and vendors
- Format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`

---

## What is CWE?

**CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)** categorizes software **weaknesses** — like coding mistakes or architectural flaws — that can lead to vulnerabilities.

- CWE is about **why** the vulnerability exists
- CVE is about a **specific vulnerability instance**

## CVE vs CWE

| Topic | CVE | CWE |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Focus | Specific vulnerability | Category of weakness |
| Example | CVE-2024-4321 | CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) |
| Use Case | Patch management, threat detection | Code auditing, secure development |

---

## Why These Matter

- Attackers exploit CVEs.
- Developers must eliminate CWEs.
- Defenders track CVEs using tools like:
  - NVD (nvd.nist.gov)
  - CVE Details
  - Exploit DB
  - GitHub Security Advisories

> Stay secure by staying informed. Use CVE feeds, automate patching, and eliminate CWEs from your codebase early in development.
