# IAM and PAM Report

## 1. Introduction

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
IAM is a framework of policies, technologies, and processes used to ensure that the right individuals have the appropriate access to technology resources at the right times for the right reasons.

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
PAM is a subset of IAM focused specifically on monitoring, controlling, and securing privileged accounts that have elevated access to critical systems and sensitive data.

## 2. Why IAM and PAM Are Used

### IAM Uses:
1. **Centralized Access Control** – Ensures all user accounts are managed from a single point.
2. **Authentication and Authorization** – Verifies identity and grants permissions.
3. **Regulatory Compliance** – Helps meet requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001.
4. **Improved Security** – Reduces the risk of unauthorized access and insider threats.
5. **Operational Efficiency** – Automates user provisioning and deprovisioning.

### PAM Uses:
1. **Protect Privileged Accounts** – Admin, root, service accounts.
2. **Reduce Insider Threats** – Session monitoring and keystroke logging.
3. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** – Temporary access provisioning to reduce standing privileges.
4. **Audit and Compliance** – Detailed logging for investigations.
5. **Credential Vaulting** – Secure storage of admin credentials.

## 3. Logic of IAM and PAM

### IAM Logic Flow:
1. **User Enrollment** – Identity proofing and account creation.
2. **Authentication** – Verify identity using passwords, MFA, biometrics.
3. **Authorization** – Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC).
4. **Access Review** – Periodic verification of user access rights.
5. **Deprovisioning** – Removing access when no longer needed.

### PAM Logic Flow:
1. **Identify Privileged Accounts** – Discovery of admin/root/service accounts.
2. **Vault Credentials** – Store in secure, encrypted vault.
3. **Access Request** – Admins request access through PAM.
4. **Session Control** – Record and monitor privileged sessions.
5. **Revoke Access** – Automatically terminate and rotate credentials.

## 5. Convincing Management to Onboard IAM and PAM

### Key Arguments:
1. **Risk Reduction** – Prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
2. **Regulatory Compliance** – Avoid penalties and meet industry regulations.
3. **Operational Efficiency** – Reduce IT overhead with automated provisioning and access reviews.
4. **Incident Response** – Faster breach detection and forensic analysis.
5. **Reputation Protection** – Avoid brand damage from security incidents.

### ROI Perspective:
- Cost of a breach (millions) vs. investment in IAM/PAM.
- Reduced downtime from faster incident resolution.
- Minimized insider threat risks.

## 6. Conclusion
IAM and PAM are critical components of modern cybersecurity. While IAM ensures every identity in the organization is authenticated and authorized properly, PAM secures the highest-value accounts with strict controls and monitoring. Together, they form a robust defense against both external and internal threats.
