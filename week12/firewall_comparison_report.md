# Comparison Report: Traditional Firewalls, Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW), and Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

## **1. Introduction**
Firewalls are security devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Over time, firewall technology has evolved to address new and complex threats.

---

## **2. Traditional Firewalls**

### **2.1 Overview**
- Also known as **packet-filtering firewalls** or **stateful inspection firewalls**.
- Operate mainly at **Layers 3 and 4** of the OSI model (Network and Transport layers).

### **2.2 Capabilities**
- Filter traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- Maintain a **state table** to track active sessions (in stateful inspection firewalls).

### **2.3 Limitations**
- Cannot inspect encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS) without additional configuration.
- Limited visibility into application-level threats.

---

## **3. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**

### **3.1 Overview**
- Combine traditional firewall capabilities with advanced security features.
- Operate across **multiple OSI layers** (3–7).

### **3.2 Capabilities**
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to analyze packet payloads.
- Application awareness and control (identifies apps like Facebook, Dropbox).
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) integration.
- SSL/TLS decryption for encrypted traffic inspection.
- User identity integration (e.g., via Active Directory).

### **3.3 Advantages**
- Detects and blocks advanced threats such as zero-day attacks and malware.
- Granular control over application usage.

### **3.4 Limitations**
- More complex to configure and manage.
- Higher resource requirements and cost.

## **4. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**

### **4.1 Overview**
- Specifically designed to protect **web applications**.
- Operate at **Layer 7** of the OSI model (Application layer).

### **4.2 Capabilities**
- Filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP/HTTPS traffic to and from a web application.
- Protects against common web exploits like:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - File inclusion attacks
- Can be network-based, host-based, or cloud-based.

### **4.3 Advantages**
- Tailored protection for web applications.
- Virtual patching for vulnerabilities until code fixes are applied.

### **4.4 Limitations**
- Does not provide broader network protection.
- May introduce latency if not properly configured.

| **Deep Packet Inspection**   | ❌ (basic inspection only) | ✅                                   | ✅ (for HTTP/S)                      |
| **Application Awareness**    | ❌                         | ✅                                   | ✅ (web applications only)           |
| **Intrusion Prevention**     | ❌                         | ✅                                   | ❌                                   |
| **SSL/TLS Inspection**       | ❌                         | ✅                                   | ✅                                   |
| **Primary Focus**            | Network-level protection   | Comprehensive network & app security | Web application security            |
| **Example Use Case**         | Perimeter network control  | Enterprise multi-layer threat defense| Protecting websites and APIs        |

## **6. Conclusion**
- **Traditional Firewalls** are suitable for basic network boundary control but lack advanced detection capabilities.
- **Next-Generation Firewalls** provide robust multi-layered security with deep packet inspection, application awareness, and IPS features, making them ideal for enterprise defense.
- **Web Application Firewalls** focus solely on protecting web applications from specific vulnerabilities, complementing other firewalls rather than replacing them.

**Recommendation:** Use NGFWs for broad network security and WAFs to secure public-facing web applications.
