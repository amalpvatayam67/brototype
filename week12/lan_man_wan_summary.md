# Summary Report: LAN, MAN, and WAN

## **1. Local Area Network (LAN)**

### **1.1 Overview**
- **Definition:** A network that covers a small geographic area, such as a single building, office, or home.
- **Range:** Up to a few kilometers.
- **Ownership:** Typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single organization or individual.

### **1.2 Characteristics**
- High data transfer speeds (up to 10 Gbps or more).
- Low latency and high reliability.
- Common technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

### **1.3 Uses**
- Connecting computers, printers, and other devices within an office.
- Sharing files and resources among local users.
- Hosting local servers and applications.

## **2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**

### **2.1 Overview**
- **Definition:** A network that spans a city or a large campus, connecting multiple LANs.
- **Range:** Up to 50 kilometers.
- **Ownership:** Usually maintained by telecom providers, ISPs, or large organizations.

### **2.2 Characteristics**
- Moderate to high data transfer speeds.
- Bridges the gap between LAN and WAN in terms of coverage.
- Common technologies: Fiber optics, Metro Ethernet.

### **2.3 Uses**
- Connecting branches of a business across a city.
- Linking government offices within a metropolitan area.
- Providing high-speed internet access to urban areas.

## **3. Wide Area Network (WAN)**

### **3.1 Overview**
- **Definition:** A network that spans large geographical areas, potentially worldwide, connecting multiple LANs and MANs.
- **Range:** Hundreds to thousands of kilometers.
- **Ownership:** Managed by multiple service providers and organizations.

### **3.2 Characteristics**
- Lower speeds compared to LAN (varies depending on connection type).
- Higher latency due to long-distance data transmission.
- Common technologies: MPLS, satellite links, undersea fiber optic cables.

### **3.3 Uses**
- Facilitating communication between multinational offices.
- Providing internet connectivity across countries and continents.
- Supporting cloud services, video conferencing, and global collaboration.

| Feature        | LAN                            | MAN                              | WAN                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Coverage**   | Small (building, campus)       | Medium (city, metro area)         | Large (country, global)               |
| **Speed**      | High (up to 10+ Gbps)           | Medium to high                    | Varies (often lower than LAN)          |
| **Ownership**  | Private                        | Public or private                 | Multiple providers                     |
| **Cost**       | Low (equipment + maintenance)   | Medium                            | High                                   |
| **Typical Use**| Office/home networking          | City-wide connectivity            | Global communication                   |
