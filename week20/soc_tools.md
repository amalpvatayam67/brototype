# Security Operations Center (SOC) Tools and SIEM Analysis

This document provides a detailed summary of essential Security Operations Center (SOC) tools and technologies, outlines the process of integrating logs into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and creating detection rules, and includes an analysis report on three leading SIEM solutions.

## 1. Detailed Summary of SOC Tools and Technologies

A Security Operations Center (SOC) relies on a robust set of tools to achieve its primary mission: **monitor, detect, analyze, and respond** to security incidents.

| Tool/Technology | Acronym | Core Purpose | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security Information and Event Management** | SIEM | Centralized collection, aggregation, and real-time analysis of log and event data to identify security threats. | Event correlation, log management, real-time alerting, compliance reporting, and forensic investigation support. |
| **Endpoint Detection and Response** | EDR | Continuous monitoring of endpoint activities (workstations, servers) to detect and respond to threats that bypass traditional anti-virus. | Threat hunting, forensic analysis of endpoint activity, rapid incident response, and process monitoring. |
| **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System** | IDS/IPS | Monitors network traffic for malicious activity or policy violations. IDS **alerts**; IPS can **actively block** threats. | Signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and real-time alerts. |
| **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response** | SOAR | Automates and streamlines incident response workflows (playbooks) to improve efficiency and reduce response time. | Workflow automation, case management, and integration with other security tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR). |
| **Threat Intelligence Platform** | TIP | Aggregates, normalizes, and contextualizes external threat data (IOCs) and integrates them into security controls. | Indicator feed aggregation, threat scoring/contextualization, and integration with SIEM/EDR for proactive defense. |
| **Vulnerability Scanner** | VS | Identifies, quantifies, and ranks weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. | Automated scanning, vulnerability reporting with severity scores (CVSS), and patch management prioritization. |
| **Identity and Access Management** | IAM | Manages user identities, authentication, and authorization to ensure the right people have the right access. | Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and user provisioning/de-provisioning. |

## 2. Process of Integrating Logs into SIEM and Creating Detection Rules

Integrating logs and building effective detection rules is the fundamental process for transforming a SIEM platform into an active threat-detection engine.

### 2.1. Log Integration Process

1.  **Data Source Strategy & Prioritization:**
    * Identify and prioritize high-value sources (e.g., Firewalls, Authentication Systems, EDR).
    * Determine the collection method (Syslog, Agents, or API Connectors) for each source.
2.  **Data Ingestion and Transport:**
    * Deploy Collectors/Agents on source systems to gather raw logs.
    * Ensure secure transport using protocols like TLS/SSL to maintain data integrity.
3.  **Data Normalization and Parsing:**
    * The SIEM maps the raw log fields (`What`, `When`, `Who`) to a **standardized SIEM schema** (e.g., Elastic Common Schema - ECS).
    * Data is **enriched** by adding context (e.g., geolocation, asset criticality tags, threat intelligence data).
4.  **Data Storage and Archiving:**
    * Index the processed data for fast, real-time analysis and historical searching.
    * Implement long-term retention based on compliance requirements, archiving older logs to cost-effective storage.

### 2.2. Creating Detection Rules (Use Cases)

1.  **Define the Threat Scenario (Use Case):**
    * Start with a clear security goal, such as detecting a "Brute-Force Attack followed by a Successful Login" (mapping to MITRE ATT&CK).
2.  **Identify Required Log Data and Fields:**
    * Determine necessary log sources (e.g., VPN logs, Authentication logs) and the specific, normalized fields required for the logic.
3.  **Develop the Correlation Logic (The Rule):**
    * Create logic that links multiple low-severity events into a single high-fidelity incident.
    * *Example:* Correlate `>5 failed login attempts` (Condition 1) from the same user/IP with a `Successful Login` (Condition 2) immediately following, and an alert where the success is from a `New/Anomalous Geo-Location` (Condition 3).
4.  **Tuning and Validation (Minimizing False Positives):**
    * Test the rule against historical data to find and eliminate false positives.
    * Adjust thresholds and add exceptions (e.g., exclude known test IPs) to ensure the rule generates **high-fidelity alerts**.
5.  **Define the Response Action:**
    * Specify the immediate action: Generate a High Severity Alert, or automate a response using SOAR (e.g., block the source IP, disable the user account).

## 3. Analysis Report on Three SIEM Tools 

| Feature | Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) | Microsoft Sentinel (Azure Sentinel) | Elastic Stack (ELK/E-S-K) Security |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Architecture** | Proprietary Search Language (SPL), massive log aggregation engine. On-prem or Cloud. | Cloud-native (Azure) SIEM and SOAR solution. Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL). | Open-source foundation (Elasticsearch, Kibana). Highly flexible deployment. |
| **Best For** | Large, complex enterprises; organizations prioritizing deep forensic analysis and customization. | Organizations heavily invested in the Microsoft/Azure ecosystem; cloud-first security operations. | Budget-conscious organizations; those preferring open standards and high-volume data collection. |
| **Pricing Model** | Primarily **ingestion-volume** based (per GB/day), can be very costly. | **Pay-as-you-go** based on ingested data and retention time; cost-effective for cloud. | Based on **usage tier/features** (Basic is free); costs tied to node count for advanced features. |

### Pros and Cons Comparison
