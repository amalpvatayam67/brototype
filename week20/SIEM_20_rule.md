# ðŸš¨ 20 SIEM Security Detection Rule Logics

These rules are designed to detect common and critical security threats across various log sources (e.g., Active Directory/Authentication, Firewall/Network, Endpoint/OS, Web/Application).

## 1. Unauthorized Access & Brute Force

These rules focus on identifying suspicious login attempts and access failures.

## 3. Malware & Endpoint Activity

These rules identify anomalous process execution and communication patterns associated with malware.
