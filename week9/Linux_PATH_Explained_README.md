# Understanding PATH in Linux

## a) Significance of PATH

The `PATH` is an **environment variable** in Linux that tells the shell **where to look for executable files** when you type a command in the terminal.

### ✅ Why is PATH Important?

- It saves you from typing full paths for commands.
- Without it, you'd need to run commands like `/usr/bin/ls` instead of just `ls`.
- The shell searches directories listed in `PATH` in the order they appear.

### 🧠 Example:
If PATH is:
```bash
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

When you type `python`, the shell looks for an executable called `python` in each of those directories **from left to right** and runs the first match it finds.

## b) Viewing and Modifying the PATH Variable

### 👁️‍🗨️ View Current PATH
```bash
echo $PATH
```

### ➕ Temporarily Add a Directory to PATH
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/your/custom/directory
```
- This change lasts **only for the current session**.

### 🛠️ Make PATH Changes Permanent

Edit your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) and add:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/your/custom/directory
```
Then run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### ⚠️ Notes:
- Be cautious when modifying PATH — incorrect paths can break command execution.
- Always append or prepend to the existing PATH using `$PATH`.

> Understanding and managing your PATH properly is crucial for customizing your environment and running custom scripts or tools effectively.
